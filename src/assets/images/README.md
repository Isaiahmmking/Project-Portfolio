# Images Folder

This is where you can store all your images for the portfolio.

## How to add images:
1. Drop your image files directly into this folder
2. Import them in your code like this:
   ```typescript
   import myImage from '@/assets/images/your-image.jpg';
   ```

## Supported formats:
- .jpg, .jpeg
- .png
- .gif
- .svg
- .webp

## Tips:
- Use descriptive filenames
- Keep images optimized for web (under 2MB recommended)
- Use lowercase and hyphens for filenames (e.g., "my-project-screenshot.jpg")
